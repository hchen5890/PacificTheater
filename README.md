<p> Welcome to my game project! I worked on this with my partner Damon Tang and we based this game from WWII, where IJN Hiryu and USS Yorktown actually fought each other through air raids. In this game, you first have to defend against kamikaze planes, but afterwards you get to attack IJN Hiryu, whom is heavily guarded by kamikaze planes. </p>
